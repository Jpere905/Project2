And they will tire of them, too, because everyone eventually tires of online acts. Mr. Trump resembles a hot app or viral video or popular video game or cool start-up that can suddenly go ice-cold.\"\n\nNow, I don't know where Ms. Swisher lives, but I'm going to hazard a guess that she doesn't live among too many Trump voters.\n\nThe notion that his voters will tire and simply move on is wishful thinking. As long as he has even the most remote possibility of running again in 2024, his voters will stay by him.\n\nAgain, the vast majority of this 70+ million people believe the election was \"stolen\" from Trump. They will continue to literally hang onto his every word, whether it be on Twitter or elsewhere. And even if Twitter does ban Trump at some point (which I doubt), there are always any number of other social media outlets, and cable outlets where he can continue to spew his garbage, to the joy of his cult-like following.\n\nNo, Trump's voters had a taste of power, and they're not going to let go of it so easily. The most grossly unfit man ever to hold the office gave them the version of America they wanted. If they were going to have tired of Trump, they would have done so long ago.\n\nRegardless of Twitter, Trump remains and threat, and his voters remain a threat. And the rest of us need to remain vigilant.",

The vast majority (at least here) get their \"news\" from one place and one place only: what comes across their Facebook pages (to be fair, this is also true of the leftists here; I worked with one 20-something Dem who hated Trump, yet refused to vote this year because he was convinced by an edited photo on Facebook of the same execrable, unrepeatable lie about Joe Biden I've heard repeated dozens of times by Trump voters). They never read a newspaper or watch a news program (even Fox). So really, I think it all comes down to whether or not time and algorithmic changes blunt his ever-presence on that particular platform.",

At this point, I would like Trump to be quiet, stop twittering, go golfing every day. I don't care about his taxes at all. I am looking forward to his children going back to whatever their lives are and never to be heard from again. He had his four years to MAGA, but he failed in my opinion. The results of his reign are unacceptable. I am looking forward to the leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.",

Where is the accountability for this utterly inhumane, morally vacuous behaviour? \n\nThe cases from SDNY pale in comparison. This requires The Hague.",

Maybe it is easier to focus on the bright shiny object, but the elephant in the room is really Trump supporters.\n\nWho are Trump's supporters, and why are there so many of them? Why are reporters so unwilling to delve into the proto-campaign of Trump promoting the Birther Myth, a Big Lie with no equal in modern American politics?\n\nThe Birther Myth gathered a base of racist Neo-Confederates around Trump that he could then use to batter down all of the other Republican presidential candidates. Impressively, only Putin and the Kremlin seemed to understand that this could really work. \n\nThe heart of the matter is that we have a core group in the Evangelical Party that can dictate how their false front Republicans will speak and act. \n\nThe Evangelical Party, formed in 1845 by the Southern Baptists, is still fighting the Civil War now rebranded as the Culture War. \n\nAnd they are winnihg that war.",

He is a \u201cShock Jock\u201d provocateur and we are all tired of him. \n\nLong time ago, visionary Canadian media philosopher Marshall McLuhan predicted about the \u201cPost Literate Society\u201d with the advent of multimedia technology. With social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook etc, the \u201cPost Literate Society\u201d is here now: People don\u2019t \u201cread and reflect\u201d anymore, people just \u201creact\u201d to Twitter feeds. \n\nTwitter co founder Ev Williams regretted inventing Twitter that may have led to Donald Trump\u2019s controversial presidential victory. \n\nLastly, one more of McLuhan\u2019s predictions also became true: \u201cMedium is the Medium\u201d. In other words, the medium is more important than the message. For example, Trump\u2019s early morning tweets tend to carry more significance albeit his messages frequently tend to be malapropism oriented and syntactically challenged. \n\nI\u2019m sick of Trump\u2019s tweets - I need normalcy in my life.",

(anybody spend any time thinking about Jimmy Swaggart these days?)    How many people actually paid much attention to trump after The Apprentice was over and before he was president?    He is going to go back to stand in front of a very small audience.  If nothing else, they are going to get tired of being hounded for money.",

Every fad eventually passes. I think we havent heard from him because he hasnt been able to come up with a new wheeze to get attention or take peoples minds off the election. It looks like he was maybe thinking Iran, but he is chicken when it comes to actual war, and was easily talked out of it. He aint no general....and he knows it. He prefers stealth bombing on home territory.",
